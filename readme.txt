Current issues:
fish are supposed to have some size variety but thats not currently working
clicking a fish is supoosed to make it change direction, but it doesn't

Features to implement:
when you name a fish with words that mention size, it will generate a fish of that size (example: "Big Ron" makes a big fish, etc)
There is a 1/100 chance that when a fish hits the wall of the aquarium it will just leave the aquarium, so we keep down on how many fish
fish have eyes, which can be selected when you add a fish
	round (surprised)
	half lidded (boared)
	half lidded (happy)
	the eyes blink, pupils look around
the fish have fins that wiggle
the rear fin wiggles
a little crab walks along the bottom, slowly from one side to the other, sometimes
